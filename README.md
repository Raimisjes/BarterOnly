# BarterOnly

BarterOnly is an ecommerce platform where customers can list items they no longer need in exchange for cash or an exchange item. Customers can search the marketplace with hundreds of items, sort products based on certain attributes(date, price, rating) and categorize items. After acquiring an account, customers can either make a purchase for the full value of product or acquire item by making an exchange. A key feature of this platform is that it automatically matches a customer with other customers who are looking for items that they have.
